# ComputerVision
Code I've written while learning basic computer vision skills. The notebooks here are my code to create a CNN that distinguishes between cars and trucks.

Step by step CNN building walkthrough involving:
1. **filter** with a convolution layer
2. **detect** with ReLU activation
3. **condense** with a maximum pooling layer
